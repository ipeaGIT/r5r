    /**
     * Is this transfer allowance as good as or better than another transfer allowance? This does not consider the fare
     * paid so fare, and can be thought of as follows. If you are standing at a stop, and a perfectly trustworthy person
     * comes up to you and offers you two tickets, one with this transfer allowance, and one with the other transfer
     * allowance, is this one as good as or better than the other one for any trip that you might make? (Assume you have
     * no moral scruples about obtaining a transfer slip from someone else who is probably not supposed to be giving
     * them away).
     *
     * In the base class, this is true iff this transfer allowance has the same or higher value, and the same or later
     * expiration time, the same or higher number of transfers remaining. In subclasses for transit systems that have
     * different services, this may need to be overridden because not all transfer allowances are comparable. For example,
     * in Greater Boston, transfers from local bus can be applied to local bus, subway, or express bus; transfers from
     * subway can be applied to other subway services at the same station, local bus, or express bus, and transfers from
     * express bus can be applied to only local bus or subway. So the values of those three types of transfers are not
     * comparable.

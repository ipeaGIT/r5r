/**
 * This class produces regular grids of travel times, used in isochrones, using the Conveyal
 * WebMercatorGridPointSet (the same as is used in the Conveyal UI). By returning travel times
 * as a raster, isochrone generation is more computationally efficient (because the very efficient
 * marching squares algorithm can be used). Resulting isochrones are more accurate as well, because
 * the marching squares algorithm uses information both about what cells are unreachable as well as
 * what cells are reachable. This way the isochrone cannot include any unreachable area (except perhaps
 * a small amount due to interpolation between grid cells), whereas the concave-hull algorithm used
 * previously uses a heuristic to identify unreachable areas.

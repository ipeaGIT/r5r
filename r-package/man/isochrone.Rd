\arguments{
\item{r5r_core}{An object to connect with the R5 routing engine, created with
\code{\link[=setup_r5]{setup_r5()}}.}

\item{origins}{Either a \verb{POINT sf} object with WGS84 CRS, or a
\code{data.frame} containing the columns \code{id}, \code{lon} and \code{lat}.}

\item{mode}{A character vector. The transport modes allowed for access,
transfer and vehicle legs of the trips. Defaults to \code{WALK}. Please see
details for other options.}

\item{mode_egress}{A character vector. The transport mode used after egress
from the last public transport. It can be either \code{WALK}, \code{BICYCLE} or
\code{CAR}. Defaults to \code{WALK}. Ignored when public transport is not used.}

\item{cutoffs}{numeric vector. Number of minutes to define the time span of
each Isochrone. Defaults to \code{c(0, 15, 30)}.}

\item{sample_size}{numeric. Sample size of nodes in the transport network used
to estimate isochrones. Defaults to \code{0.8} (80\% of all nodes in the
transport network). Value can range between \code{0.2} and \code{1}. Smaller
values increase computation speed but return results with lower
precision. This parameter has no effect when \code{polygon_output = FALSE}.}

\item{departure_datetime}{A POSIXct object. Please note that the departure
time only influences public transport legs. When working with public
transport networks, please check the \code{calendar.txt} within your GTFS
feeds for valid dates. Please see details for further information on
how datetimes are parsed.}

\item{polygon_output}{A Logical. If \code{TRUE}, the function outputs
polygon-based isochrones (the default) based on travel times from each
origin to a sample of a random  sample nodes in the transport network
(see parameter \code{sample_size}). If \code{FALSE}, the function outputs
line-based isochronesbased on travel times from each origin to the
centroids of all segments in the transport network.}

\item{time_window}{An integer. The time window in minutes for which \code{r5r}
will calculate multiple travel time matrices departing each minute.
Defaults to 10 minutes. The function returns the result based on
median travel times. Please read the time window vignette for more
details on its usage \code{vignette("time_window", package = "r5r")}}

\item{max_walk_time}{An integer. The maximum walking time (in minutes) to
access and egress the transit network, or to make transfers within the
network. Defaults to no restrictions, as long as \code{max_trip_duration}
is respected. The max time is considered separately for each leg (e.g.
if you set \code{max_walk_time} to 15, you could potentially walk up to 15
minutes to reach transit, and up to \emph{another} 15 minutes to reach the
destination after leaving transit). Defaults to \code{Inf}, no limit.}

\item{max_bike_time}{An integer. The maximum cycling time (in minutes) to
access and egress the transit network. Defaults to no restrictions, as
long as \code{max_trip_duration} is respected. The max time is considered
separately for each leg (e.g. if you set \code{max_bike_time} to 15 minutes,
you could potentially cycle up to 15 minutes to reach transit, and up
to \emph{another} 15 minutes to reach the destination after leaving
transit). Defaults to \code{Inf}, no limit.}

\item{max_car_time}{An integer. The maximum driving time (in minutes) to
access and egress the transit network. Defaults to no restrictions, as
long as \code{max_trip_duration} is respected. The max time is considered
separately for each leg (e.g. if you set \code{max_car_time} to 15 minutes,
you could potentially drive up to 15 minutes to reach transit, and up
to \emph{another} 15 minutes to reach the destination after leaving transit).
Defaults to \code{Inf}, no limit.}

\item{max_trip_duration}{An integer. The maximum trip duration in minutes.
Defaults to 120 minutes (2 hours).}

\item{walk_speed}{A numeric. Average walk speed in km/h. Defaults to 3.6 km/h.}

\item{bike_speed}{A numeric. Average cycling speed in km/h. Defaults to 12 km/h.}

\item{max_rides}{An integer. The maximum number of public transport rides
allowed in the same trip. Defaults to 3.}

\item{max_lts}{An integer between 1 and 4. The maximum level of traffic
stress that cyclists will tolerate. A value of 1 means cyclists will
only travel through the quietest streets, while a value of 4 indicates
cyclists can travel through any road. Defaults to 2. Please see
details for more information.}

\item{draws_per_minute}{An integer. The number of Monte Carlo draws to
perform per time window minute when calculating travel time matrices and
when estimating accessibility. Defaults to 5. This would mean 300 draws in
a 60-minute time window, for example. This parameter only affects the
results when the GTFS feeds contain a \code{frequencies.txt} table. If the GTFS
feed does not have a frequency table, r5r still allows for multiple runs
over the set \code{time_window} but in a deterministic way.}

\item{n_threads}{An integer. The number of threads to use when running the
router in parallel. Defaults to use all available threads (\code{Inf}).}

\item{verbose}{A logical. Whether to show \code{R5} informative messages when
running the function. Defaults to \code{FALSE} (please note that in such case
\code{R5} error messages are still shown). Setting \code{verbose} to \code{TRUE} shows
detailed output, which can be useful for debugging issues not caught by
\code{r5r}.}

\item{progress}{A logical. Whether to show a progress counter when running
the router. Defaults to \code{FALSE}. Only works when \code{verbose} is set to
\code{FALSE}, so the progress counter does not interfere with \code{R5}'s output
messages. Setting \code{progress} to \code{TRUE} may impose a small penalty for
computation efficiency, because the progress counter must be
synchronized among all active threads.}
}
\value{
A \verb{POLYGON  "sf" "data.frame"} for each isochrone of each origin.
}
\description{
Fast computation of isochrones from a given location. The
function can return either polygon-based or line-based isochrones.
Polygon-based isochrones are generated as concave polygons based on the
travel times from the trip origin to all nodes in the transport network.
Meanwhile, line-based isochronesare based on travel times from each origin
to the centroids of all segments in the transport network.
}
\section{Transport modes}{


\code{R5} allows for multiple combinations of transport modes. The options
include:
\itemize{
\item \strong{Transit modes:} \code{TRAM}, \code{SUBWAY}, \code{RAIL}, \code{BUS}, \code{FERRY}, \code{CABLE_CAR},
\code{GONDOLA}, \code{FUNICULAR}. The option \code{TRANSIT} automatically considers all
public transport modes available.
\item \strong{Non transit modes:} \code{WALK}, \code{BICYCLE}, \code{CAR}, \code{BICYCLE_RENT},
\code{CAR_PARK}.
}
}

\section{Level of Traffic Stress (LTS)}{


When cycling is enabled in \code{R5} (by passing the value \code{BIKE} to either
\code{mode} or \code{mode_egress}), setting \code{max_lts} will allow cycling only on
streets with a given level of danger/stress. Setting \code{max_lts} to 1, for
example, will allow cycling only on separated bicycle infrastructure or
low-traffic streets and routing will revert to walking when traversing any
links with LTS exceeding 1. Setting \code{max_lts} to 3 will allow cycling on
links with LTS 1, 2 or 3. Routing also reverts to walking if the street
segment is tagged as non-bikable in OSM (e.g. a staircase), independently of
the specified max LTS.

The default methodology for assigning LTS values to network edges is based
on commonly tagged attributes of OSM ways. See more info about LTS in the
original documentation of R5 from Conveyal at
\url{https://docs.conveyal.com/learn-more/traffic-stress}. In summary:
\itemize{
\item \strong{LTS 1}: Tolerable for children. This includes low-speed, low-volume
streets, as well as those with separated bicycle facilities (such as
parking-protected lanes or cycle tracks).
\item \strong{LTS 2}: Tolerable for the mainstream adult population. This includes
streets where cyclists have dedicated lanes and only have to interact with
traffic at formal crossing.
\item \strong{LTS 3}: Tolerable for "enthused and confident" cyclists. This includes
streets which may involve close proximity to moderate- or high-speed
vehicular traffic.
\item \strong{LTS 4}: Tolerable only for "strong and fearless" cyclists. This
includes streets where cyclists are required to mix with moderate- to
high-speed vehicular traffic.
}

For advanced users, you can provide custom LTS values by adding a tag \verb{<key = "lts">} to the \code{osm.pbf} file.
}

\section{Datetime parsing}{


\code{r5r} ignores the timezone attribute of datetime objects when parsing dates
and times, using the study area's timezone instead. For example, let's say
you are running some calculations using Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, as your study
area. The datetime \code{as.POSIXct("13-05-2019 14:00:00", format = "\%d-\%m-\%Y \%H:\%M:\%S")} will be parsed as May 13th, 2019, 14:00h in
Rio's local time, as expected. But \code{as.POSIXct("13-05-2019 14:00:00", format = "\%d-\%m-\%Y \%H:\%M:\%S", tz = "Europe/Paris")} will also be parsed as
the exact same date and time in Rio's local time, perhaps surprisingly,
ignoring the timezone attribute.
}

\section{Routing algorithm}{


The \code{\link[=travel_time_matrix]{travel_time_matrix()}}, \code{\link[=expanded_travel_time_matrix]{expanded_travel_time_matrix()}} and
\code{\link[=accessibility]{accessibility()}} functions use an \code{R5}-specific extension to the RAPTOR
routing algorithm (see Conway et al., 2017). This RAPTOR extension uses a
systematic sample of one departure per minute over the time window set by the
user in the 'time_window' parameter. A detailed description of base RAPTOR
can be found in Delling et al (2015). However, whenever the user includes
transit fares inputs to these functions, they automatically switch to use an
\code{R5}-specific extension to the McRAPTOR routing algorithm.

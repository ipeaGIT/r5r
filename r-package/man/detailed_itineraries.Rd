  r5r_core,
  origins,

}
\arguments{
\item{r5r_core}{rJava object to connect with R5 routing engine}

\item{origins, destinations}{either a spatial sf POINT object or a data.frame
containing the columns 'id', 'lon', 'lat'}

\item{mode}{string. Transport modes allowed for the trips. Defaults to
"WALK". See details for other options.}

\item{mode_egress}{string. Transport mode used after egress from public
transport. It can be either 'WALK', 'BICYCLE', or 'CAR'.
Defaults to "WALK". Ignored when public transport is not
used.}

\item{departure_datetime}{POSIXct object. If working with public transport
networks, please check \code{calendar.txt} within
the GTFS file for valid dates.}

\item{max_walk_dist}{numeric. Maximum walking distance (in meters) for the
whole trip. Defaults to no restrictions on walking, as
long as \code{max_trip_duration} is respected.}

\item{max_trip_duration}{numeric. Maximum trip duration in minutes. Defaults
to 120 minutes (2 hours).}

\item{walk_speed}{numeric. Average walk speed in km/h. Defaults to 3.6 km/h.}

\item{bike_speed}{numeric. Average cycling speed in km/h. Defaults to 12 km/h.}

\item{max_rides}{numeric. The max number of public transport rides allowed in
the same trip. Defaults to 3.}

\item{max_lts}{numeric (between 1 and 4). The maximum level of traffic stress
that cyclists will tolerate. A value of 1 means cyclists will
only travel through the quietest streets, while a value of 4
indicates cyclists can travel through any road. Defaults to 2.
See details for more information.}

\item{shortest_path}{logical. Whether the function should only return the
fastest route alternative (the default) or multiple
alternatives.}

\item{n_threads}{numeric. The number of threads to use in parallel computing.
Defaults to use all available threads (Inf).}

\item{verbose}{logical. TRUE to show detailed output messages (the default)
or FALSE to show only eventual ERROR messages.}

\item{drop_geometry}{logical. Indicates whether R5 should drop segment's
geometry column. It can be helpful for saving memory.}
}
\value{
A LINESTRING sf with detailed information about the itineraries
between specified origins and destinations. Distances are in meters
and travel times are in minutes.
}
\description{
Fast computation of (multiple) detailed itineraries between one
or many origin destination pairs.
}
\section{Transpor modes:}{
R5 allows for multiple combinations of transport modes. The options include:
\subsection{Transit modes}{

TRAM, SUBWAY, RAIL, BUS, FERRY, CABLE_CAR, GONDOLA, FUNICULAR. The option
'TRANSIT' automatically considers all public transport modes available.
}

\subsection{Non transit modes}{

WALK, BICYCLE, CAR, BICYCLE_RENT, CAR_PARK
}
}

\section{max_lts, Maximum Level of Traffic Stress:}{
When cycling is enabled in R5, setting \code{max_lts} will allow cycling only on
streets with a given level of danger/stress. Setting \code{max_lts} to 1, for example,
will allow cycling only on separated bicycle infrastructure or low-traffic
streets; routing will revert to walking when traversing any links with LTS
exceeding 1. Setting \code{max_lts} to 3 will allow cycling on links with LTS 1, 2,
or 3.

The default methodology for assigning LTS values to network edges is based on
commonly tagged attributes of OSM ways. See more info about LTS at
\url{https://docs.conveyal.com/learn-more/traffic-stress}. In summary:
\itemize{
\item \strong{LTS 1}: Tolerable for children. This includes low-speed, low-volume streets,
as well as those with separated bicycle facilities (such as parking-protected
lanes or cycle tracks).
\item \strong{LTS 2}: Tolerable for the mainstream adult population. This includes streets
where cyclists have dedicated lanes and only have to interact with traffic at
formal crossing.
\item \strong{LTS 3}: Tolerable for “enthused and confident” cyclists. This includes streets
which may involve close proximity to moderate- or high-speed vehicular traffic.
\item \strong{LTS 4}: Tolerable for only “strong and fearless” cyclists. This includes streets
where cyclists are required to mix with moderate- to high-speed vehicular traffic.

\section{Routing algorithm:}{
The detailed_itineraries function uses an R5-specific extension to the
McRAPTOR routing algorithm to find paths that are optimal or less than
optimal, with some heuristics around multiple access modes, riding the same
patterns, etc. The specific extension to McRAPTOR to do suboptimal
path routing are not documented yet, but a detailed description of base
McRAPTOR can be found in Delling et al (2015).

\title{Create transport network used for routing in R5}
\usage{
setup_r5(
  data_path,
  version = "6.6.0",
  verbose = TRUE,
  temp_dir = FALSE,
  use_elevation = FALSE,
  overwrite = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data_path}{character string, the directory where data inputs are stored
and where the built network.dat will be saved.}

\item{version}{character string, the version of R5 to be used. Defaults to
latest version '6.4.0'.}

\item{verbose}{logical, TRUE to show detailed output messages (Default) or
FALSE to show only eventual ERROR and WARNING messages.}

\item{temp_dir}{logical, whether the R5 Jar file should be saved in temporary
directory. Defaults to FALSE}

\item{use_elevation}{logical. If TRUE, load any tif files containing
elevation found in the data_path folder and calculate
impedances for walking and cycling based on street
slopes.}

\item{overwrite}{logical, whether to overwrite an existing \code{network.dat} or
to use a cached file. Defaults to FALSE (i.e. use a cached
network).}
}
\value{
An rJava object to connect with R5 routing engine
}
\description{
Combine data inputs in a directory to build a multimodal transport network
used for routing in R5. The directory must contain at least one street
network file (in .pbf format). One or more public transport data sets (in
GTFS.zip format) are optional. If there is more than one GTFS file in the
directory, both files will be merged. If there is already a 'network.dat'
file in the directory the function will simply read it and load it to memory.
}

if (interactive()) {

library(r5r)

# directory with street network and gtfs files
path <- system.file("extdata/poa", package = "r5r")

r5r_core <- setup_r5(data_path = path, temp_dir = TRUE)

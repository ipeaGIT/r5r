\usage{
travel_time_matrix(
  r5r_core,
  origins,
  destinations,
  mode = "WALK",
  mode_egress = "WALK",
  departure_datetime = Sys.time(),
  time_window = 1L,
  percentiles = 50L,
  max_walk_dist = Inf,
  max_bike_dist = Inf,
  max_trip_duration = 120L,

}
\arguments{
\item{r5r_core}{a rJava object to connect with R5 routing engine}

\item{origins, destinations}{a spatial sf POINT object, or a data.frame
containing the columns 'id', 'lon', 'lat'}

\item{mode}{string. Transport modes allowed for the trips. Defaults to
"WALK". See details for other options.}

\item{mode_egress}{string. Transport mode used after egress from public
transport. It can be either 'WALK', 'BICYCLE', or 'CAR'.
Defaults to "WALK".}

\item{departure_datetime}{POSIXct object. If working with public transport
networks, please check \code{calendar.txt} within
the GTFS file for valid dates.}

\item{time_window}{numeric. Time window in minutes for which r5r will
calculate multiple travel time matrices departing each
minute. By default, the number of simulations is 5 times
the size of 'time_window' set by the user. Defaults window
size to '1', the function only considers 5 departure times.
This parameter is only used with frequency-based GTFS files.
See details for further information.}

\item{percentiles}{numeric vector. Defaults to '50', returning the median
travel time for a given time_window. If a numeric vector is passed,
for example c(25, 50, 75), the function will return
additional columns with the travel times within percentiles
of trips. For example, if the 25 percentile of trips between
A and B is 15 minutes, this means that 25\% of all trips
taken between A and B within the set time window are shorter
than 15 minutes. Only the first 5 cut points of the percentiles
are considered. For more details, see R5 documentation at
'https://docs.conveyal.com/analysis/methodology#accounting-for-variability'}

\item{max_walk_dist}{numeric. Maximum walking distance (in meters) for the
whole trip. Defaults to no restrictions on walking, as
long as \code{max_trip_duration} is respected.}

\item{max_bike_dist}{numeric. Maximum cycling distance (in meters) for the
whole trip. Defaults to no restrictions on cycling, as
long as \code{max_trip_duration} is respected.}

\item{max_trip_duration}{numeric. Maximum trip duration in minutes. Defaults
to 120 minutes (2 hours).}

\item{walk_speed}{numeric. Average walk speed in km/h. Defaults to 3.6 km/h.}

\item{bike_speed}{numeric. Average cycling speed in km/h. Defaults to 12 km/h.}

\item{max_rides}{numeric. The max number of public transport rides allowed in
the same trip. Defaults to 3.}

\item{max_lts}{numeric (between 1 and 4). The maximum level of traffic stress
that cyclists will tolerate. A value of 1 means cyclists will
only travel through the quietest streets, while a value of 4
indicates cyclists can travel through any road. Defaults to 2.
See details for more information.}

\item{n_threads}{numeric. The number of threads to use in parallel computing.
Defaults to use all available threads (Inf).}

\item{verbose}{logical. \code{TRUE} to show detailed output messages (the default).
If verbose is set to \code{FALSE}, r5r prints a progress counter and
eventual \code{ERROR} messages. Setting \code{verbose} to  \code{TRUE} imposes
a small penalty for computation efficiency.}
}
\value{
A data.table with travel time estimates (in minutes) between origin
destination pairs by a given transport mode. Note that origins/destinations
that were beyond the maximum travel time, and/or origins that were far from
the street network are not returned in the data.table.
}
\description{
Fast computation of travel time estimates between one or
multiple origin destination pairs.
}
\section{Transport modes:}{
R5 allows for multiple combinations of transport modes. The options include:
\subsection{Transit modes}{

TRAM, SUBWAY, RAIL, BUS, FERRY, CABLE_CAR, GONDOLA, FUNICULAR. The option
'TRANSIT' automatically considers all public transport modes available.
}

\subsection{Non transit modes}{

WALK, BICYCLE, CAR, BICYCLE_RENT, CAR_PARK
}
}

\section{max_lts, Maximum Level of Traffic Stress:}{
When cycling is enabled in R5, setting \code{max_lts} will allow cycling only on
streets with a given level of danger/stress. Setting \code{max_lts} to 1, for example,
will allow cycling only on separated bicycle infrastructure or low-traffic
streets; routing will revert to walking when traversing any links with LTS
exceeding 1. Setting \code{max_lts} to 3 will allow cycling on links with LTS 1, 2,
or 3.

The default methodology for assigning LTS values to network edges is based on
commonly tagged attributes of OSM ways. See more info about LTS at
\url{https://docs.conveyal.com/learn-more/traffic-stress}. In summary:
\itemize{
\item \strong{LTS 1}: Tolerable for children. This includes low-speed, low-volume streets,
as well as those with separated bicycle facilities (such as parking-protected
lanes or cycle tracks).
\item \strong{LTS 2}: Tolerable for the mainstream adult population. This includes streets
where cyclists have dedicated lanes and only have to interact with traffic at
formal crossing.
\item \strong{LTS 3}: Tolerable for “enthused and confident” cyclists. This includes streets
which may involve close proximity to moderate- or high-speed vehicular traffic.
\item \strong{LTS 4}: Tolerable for only “strong and fearless” cyclists. This includes streets
where cyclists are required to mix with moderate- to high-speed vehicular traffic.

\section{Routing algorithm:}{
The travel_time_matrix function uses an R5-specific extension to the RAPTOR
routing algorithm (see Conway et al., 2017). This RAPTOR extension uses a
systematic sample of one departure per minute over the time window set by the
user in the 'time_window' parameter. A detailed description of base RAPTOR
can be found in Delling et al (2015).

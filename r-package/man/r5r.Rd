\title{r5r: Rapid Realistic Routing with 'R5'}
\description{
Rapid realistic routing on multimodal transport networks (walk, bike, public
transport and car) using \code{R5}, the Rapid Realistic Routing on Real-world and
Reimagined networks engine \url{https://github.com/conveyal/r5}. The package
allows users to generate detailed routing analysis or calculate travel time
matrices using seamless parallel computing on top of the R5 Java machine.
While \code{R5} is developed by Conveyal, the package \code{r5r} is independently
developed by a team at the Institute for Applied Economic Research (Ipea)
with contributions from collaborators. Apart from the documentation in this
package, users will find additional information on \code{R5} documentation at
\url{https://docs.conveyal.com/}. Although we try to keep new releases of \code{r5r}
in synchrony with \code{R5}, the development of \code{R5} follows Conveyal's
independent update process. Hence, users should confirm if the \code{R5} version
implied by the Conveyal user manual (see
\url{https://docs.conveyal.com/changelog}) corresponds with the \code{R5} version
that \code{r5r} depends on.

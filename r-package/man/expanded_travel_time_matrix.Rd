\arguments{
\item{r5r_core}{An object to connect with the R5 routing engine, created with
\code{\link[=setup_r5]{setup_r5()}}.}

\item{origins, destinations}{Either a \verb{POINT sf} object with WGS84 CRS, or a
\code{data.frame} containing the columns \code{id}, \code{lon} and \code{lat}.}

\item{mode}{A character vector. The transport modes allowed for access,
transfer and vehicle legs of the trips. Defaults to \code{WALK}. Please see
details for other options.}

\item{mode_egress}{A character vector. The transport mode used after egress
from the last public transport. It can be either \code{WALK}, \code{BICYCLE} or \code{CAR}.
Defaults to \code{WALK}. Ignored when public transport is not used.}

\item{departure_datetime}{A POSIXct object. If working with public transport
networks, please check the \code{calendar.txt} within your GTFS feeds for valid
dates. Please see details for further information on how datetimes are
parsed.}

\item{time_window}{An integer. The time window in minutes for which \code{r5r}
will calculate multiple travel time matrices departing each minute. Defaults
to 1 minute. This parameter only affects the results when the GTFS feeds
contain a \code{frequencies.txt} table.}

\item{breakdown}{A logical. If \code{FALSE} (the default), the function returns a
simple output that lists the total time between each pair in each minute of
the specified time window. If \code{TRUE}, the output breaks down the trip
information, showing the routes used to complete each trip and their total
access, waiting, in-vehicle and transfer time. Please note that setting this
parameter to \code{TRUE} makes the function significantly slower.}

\item{max_walk_dist}{An integer. The maximum walking distance (in meters) to
access and egress the transit network, or to make transfers within the
network. Defaults to no restrictions, as long as \code{max_trip_duration} is
respected. The max distance is considered separately for each leg (e.g. if
you set \code{max_walk_dist} to 1000, you could potentially walk up to 1 km to
reach transit, and up to \emph{another} 1 km to reach the destination after
leaving transit). Please note that this parameter doesn't affect the maximum
length of walking-only trips, only walking access, egress and transfer legs.
If you want to set a maximum walking distance for walking-only trips you
have to use the \code{max_trip_duration} parameter (e.g. to set a walking-only
trip max distance of 1 km, assuming a walking speed of 3.6 km/h, you have to
set \code{max_trip_duration = 1 / 3.6 * 60}).}

\item{max_bike_dist}{An integer. The maximum cycling distance (in meters) to
access and egress the transit network, or to make transfers within the
network. Defaults to no restrictions, as long as \code{max_trip_duration} is
respected. The max distance is considered separately for each leg (e.g. if
you set \code{max_bike_dist} to 1000, you could potentially cycle up to 1 km to
reach transit, and up to \emph{another} 1 km to reach the destination after
leaving transit). Please note that this parameter doesn't affect the maximum
length of cycling-only trips, only cycling access, egress and transfer legs.
If you want to set a maximum cycling distance for cycling-only trips you
have to use the \code{max_trip_duration} parameter (e.g. to set a walking-only
trip max distance of 5 km, assuming a cycling speed of 12 km/h, you have to
set \code{max_trip_duration = 5 / 12 * 60}).}

\item{max_trip_duration}{An integer. The maximum trip duration in minutes.
Defaults to 120 minutes (2 hours).}

\item{walk_speed}{A numeric. Average walk speed in km/h. Defaults to 3.6
km/h.}

\item{bike_speed}{A numeric. Average cycling speed in km/h. Defaults to 12
km/h.}

\item{max_rides}{An integer. The maximum number of public transport rides
allowed in the same trip. Defaults to 3.}

\item{max_lts}{An integer between 1 and 4. The maximum level of traffic
stress that cyclists will tolerate. A value of 1 means cyclists will only
travel through the quietest streets, while a value of 4 indicates cyclists
can travel through any road. Defaults to 2. Please see details for more
information.}

\item{draws_per_minute}{An integer. The number of Monte Carlo draws to
perform per time window minute when calculating travel time matrices and
when estimating accessibility. Defaults to 5. This would mean 300 draws in a
60 minutes time window, for example.}

\item{n_threads}{An integer. The number of threads to use when running the
router in parallel. Defaults to use all available threads (Inf).}

\item{verbose}{A logical. Whether to show \code{R5} informative messages when
running the function. Defaults to \code{FALSE} (please note that in such case \code{R5}
error messages are still shown). Setting \code{verbose} to \code{TRUE} shows detailed
output, which can be useful for debugging issues not caught by \code{r5r}.}

\item{progress}{A logical. Whether to show a progress counter when running
the router. Defaults to \code{FALSE}. Only works when \code{verbose} is set to \code{FALSE},
so the progress counter does not interfere with \code{R5}'s output messages.
Setting \code{progress} to \code{TRUE} may impose a small penalty for computation
efficiency, because the progress counter must be synchronized among all
active threads.}

\item{output_dir}{Either \code{NULL} or a path to an existing directory. When not
\code{NULL} (the default), the function will write one \code{.csv} file with the
results for each origin in the specified directory. In such case, the
function returns the path specified in this parameter. This parameter is
particularly useful when running estimates on memory-constrained settings,
because writing the results to disk prevents \code{r5r} from storing them in
memory.}
}
\value{
A \code{data.table} with travel time estimates (in minutes) between
origin and destination pairs for each minute of the specified time window. A
pair is absent from the final output if no trips could be completed in any
of the minutes of the time window. If \code{output_dir} is not \code{NULL}, the
function returns the path specified in that parameter, in which the \code{.csv}
files containing the results are saved.
}
\description{
Detailed computation of travel time estimates between one or multiple origin
destination pairs. Results show the travel time of the fastest route
alternative departing each minute within a specified time window. Please
note this function can be very memory intensive for large data sets and time
windows.
}
\section{Transport modes}{


\code{R5} allows for multiple combinations of transport modes. The options
include:
\itemize{
\item \strong{Transit modes:} \code{TRAM}, \code{SUBWAY}, \code{RAIL}, \code{BUS}, \code{FERRY}, \code{CABLE_CAR},
\code{GONDOLA}, \code{FUNICULAR}. The option \code{TRANSIT} automatically considers all
public transport modes available.
\item \strong{Non transit modes:} \code{WALK}, \code{BICYCLE}, \code{CAR}, \code{BICYCLE_RENT},
\code{CAR_PARK}.
}
}

\section{Level of Traffic Stress (LTS)}{


When cycling is enabled in \code{R5} (by passing the value \code{BIKE} to either
\code{mode} or \code{mode_egress}), setting \code{max_lts} will allow cycling only on
streets with a given level of danger/stress. Setting \code{max_lts} to 1, for
example, will allow cycling only on separated bicycle infrastructure or
low-traffic streets and routing will revert to walking when traversing any
links with LTS exceeding 1. Setting \code{max_lts} to 3 will allow cycling on
links with LTS 1, 2 or 3. Routing also reverts to walking if the street
segment is tagged as non-bikable in OSM (e.g. a staircase), independently of
the specified max LTS.

The default methodology for assigning LTS values to network edges is based
on commonly tagged attributes of OSM ways. See more info about LTS in the
original documentation of R5 from Conveyal at
\url{https://docs.conveyal.com/learn-more/traffic-stress}. In summary:
\itemize{
\item \strong{LTS 1}: Tolerable for children. This includes low-speed, low-volume
streets, as well as those with separated bicycle facilities (such as
parking-protected lanes or cycle tracks).
\item \strong{LTS 2}: Tolerable for the mainstream adult population. This includes
streets where cyclists have dedicated lanes and only have to interact with
traffic at formal crossing.
\item \strong{LTS 3}: Tolerable for â€œenthused and confidentâ€ cyclists. This includes
streets which may involve close proximity to moderate- or high-speed
vehicular traffic.
\item \strong{LTS 4}: Tolerable only for â€œstrong and fearlessâ€ cyclists. This
includes streets where cyclists are required to mix with moderate- to
high-speed vehicular traffic.
}

For advanced users, you can provide custom LTS values by adding a tag \verb{<key = "lts">} to the \code{osm.pbf} file.
}

\section{Datetime parsing}{


\code{r5r} ignores the timezone attribute of datetime objects when parsing dates
and times, using the study area's timezone instead. For example, let's say
you are running some calculations using Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, as your study
area. The datetime \code{as.POSIXct("13-05-2019 14:00:00", format = "\%d-\%m-\%Y \%H:\%M:\%S")} will be parsed as May 13th, 2019, 14:00h in
Rio's local time, as expected. But \code{as.POSIXct("13-05-2019 14:00:00", format = "\%d-\%m-\%Y \%H:\%M:\%S", tz = "Europe/Paris")} will also be parsed as
the exact same date and time in Rio's local time, perhaps surprisingly,
ignoring the timezone attribute.
}

\section{Routing algorithm}{


The \code{\link[=travel_time_matrix]{travel_time_matrix()}} and \code{\link[=accessibility]{accessibility()}} functions use an
\code{R5}-specific extension to the RAPTOR routing algorithm (see Conway et al.,
2017). This RAPTOR extension uses a systematic sample of one departure per
minute over the time window set by the user in the 'time_window' parameter.
A detailed description of base RAPTOR can be found in Delling et al (2015).

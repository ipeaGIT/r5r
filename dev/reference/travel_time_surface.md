## Arguments

- r5r_network:

  A routable transport network created with
  [`build_network()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/r5r/dev/reference/build_network.md).

- origins:

  Either a `POINT sf` object with WGS84 CRS, or a `data.frame`
  containing the columns `id`, `lon` and `lat`.

- zoom:

  Resolution of the travel time surface used to create isochrones, can
  be between 9 and 12. More detailed isochrones will result from larger
  numbers, at the expense of compute time. Specifically, a raster grid
  of travel times in the Web Mercator projection at this zoom level is
  created, and the isochrones are interpolated from this grid. For more
  information on how the grid cells are defined, see [the R5
  documentation.](https://docs.conveyal.com/analysis/methodology#zoom-levels)

- mode:

  A character vector. The transport modes allowed for access, transfer
  and vehicle legs of the trips. Defaults to `WALK`. Please see details
  for other options.

- mode_egress:

  A character vector. The transport mode used after egress from the last
  public transport. It can be either `WALK`, `BICYCLE` or `CAR`.
  Defaults to `WALK`. Ignored when public transport is not used.

- departure_datetime:

  A POSIXct object. Please note that the departure time only influences
  public transport legs. When working with public transport networks,
  please check the `calendar.txt` within your GTFS feeds for valid
  dates. Please see details for further information on how datetimes are
  parsed.

- time_window:

  An integer. The time window in minutes for which `r5r` will calculate
  multiple travel time matrices departing each minute. Defaults to 10
  minutes. The function returns the result based on median travel times.
  Please read the time window vignette for more details on its usage
  [`vignette("time_window", package = "r5r")`](https://ipeagit.github.io/r5r/dev/articles/time_window.md)

- percentiles:

  An integer vector (max length of 5). Specifies the percentile to use
  when returning accessibility estimates within the given time window.
  Please note that this parameter is applied to the travel time
  estimates that generate the accessibility results, and not to the
  accessibility distribution itself (i.e. if the 25th percentile is
  specified, the accessibility is calculated from the 25th percentile
  travel time, which may or may not be equal to the 25th percentile of
  the accessibility distribution itself). Defaults to 50, returning the
  accessibility calculated from the median travel time. If a vector with
  length bigger than 1 is passed, the output contains an additional
  column that specifies the percentile of each accessibility estimate.
  Due to upstream restrictions, only 5 percentiles can be specified at a
  time. For more details, please see `R5` documentation at
  <https://docs.conveyal.com/analysis/methodology#accounting-for-variability>.

- max_walk_time:

  An integer. The maximum walking time (in minutes) to access and egress
  the transit network, or to make transfers within the network. Defaults
  to no restrictions, as long as `max_trip_duration` is respected. The
  max time is considered separately for each leg (e.g. if you set
  `max_walk_time` to 15, you could potentially walk up to 15 minutes to
  reach transit, and up to *another* 15 minutes to reach the destination
  after leaving transit). Defaults to `Inf`, no limit.

- max_bike_time:

  An integer. The maximum cycling time (in minutes) to access and egress
  the transit network. Defaults to no restrictions, as long as
  `max_trip_duration` is respected. The max time is considered
  separately for each leg (e.g. if you set `max_bike_time` to 15
  minutes, you could potentially cycle up to 15 minutes to reach
  transit, and up to *another* 15 minutes to reach the destination after
  leaving transit). Defaults to `Inf`, no limit.

- max_car_time:

  An integer. The maximum driving time (in minutes) to access and egress
  the transit network. Defaults to no restrictions, as long as
  `max_trip_duration` is respected. The max time is considered
  separately for each leg (e.g. if you set `max_car_time` to 15 minutes,
  you could potentially drive up to 15 minutes to reach transit, and up
  to *another* 15 minutes to reach the destination after leaving
  transit). Defaults to `Inf`, no limit.

- max_trip_duration:

  An integer. The maximum trip duration in minutes. Defaults to 120
  minutes (2 hours).

- walk_speed:

  A numeric. Average walk speed in km/h. Defaults to 3.6 km/h.

- bike_speed:

  A numeric. Average cycling speed in km/h. Defaults to 12 km/h.

- max_rides:

  An integer. The maximum number of public transport rides allowed in
  the same trip. Defaults to 3.

- max_lts:

  An integer between 1 and 4. The maximum level of traffic stress that
  cyclists will tolerate. A value of 1 means cyclists will only travel
  through the quietest streets, while a value of 4 indicates cyclists
  can travel through any road. Defaults to 2. Please see details for
  more information.

- fare_structure:

  A fare structure object, following the convention set in
  [`setup_fare_structure()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/r5r/dev/reference/setup_fare_structure.md).
  This object describes how transit fares should be calculated. Please
  see the fare structure vignette to understand how this object is
  structured:
  [`vignette("fare_structure", package = "r5r")`](https://ipeagit.github.io/r5r/dev/articles/fare_structure.md).

- max_fare:

  A number. The maximum value that trips can cost when calculating the
  fastest journey between each origin and destination pair.

- new_carspeeds:

  A `data.frame` specifying the new car speed for each OSM edge id. This
  table must contain columns `osm_id`, `max_speed` and `speed_type`. The
  `"speed_type"` column is of class character and it indicates whether
  the values in `"max_speed"` should be interpreted as percentages of
  original speeds (`"scale"`) or as absolute speeds (`"km/h"`).
  Alternatively, the `new_carspeeds` parameter can receive an
  `sf data.frame` with POLYGON geometry that indicates the new car speed
  for all the roads that fall within each polygon. In this case, the
  table must contain the columns `poly_id` with a unique id for each
  polygon, `scale` with the new speed scaling factors and `priority`,
  which is a number ranking which polygon should be considered in case
  of overlapping polygons. See more into in the
  `link to congestion vignette`.

- carspeed_scale:

  Numeric. The default car speed to use for road segments not specified
  in `new_carspeeds`. By default, it is `NULL` and the speeds of the
  unlisted roads are kept unchanged.

- new_lts:

  A `data.frame` specifying the new LTS levels for each OSM edge id. The
  table must contain columns `osm_id` and `lts`. Alternatively, the
  `new_lts` parameter can receive an `sf data.frame` with LINESTRING
  geometry. R5 will then find the nearest road for each LINESTRING and
  update its LTS value accordingly.

- draws_per_minute:

  An integer. The number of Monte Carlo draws to perform per time window
  minute when calculating travel time matrices and when estimating
  accessibility. Defaults to 5. This would mean 300 draws in a 60-minute
  time window, for example. This parameter only affects the results when
  the GTFS feeds contain a `frequencies.txt` table. If the GTFS feed
  does not have a frequency table, r5r still allows for multiple runs
  over the set `time_window` but in a deterministic way.

- n_threads:

  An integer. The number of threads to use when running the router in
  parallel. Defaults to use all available threads (`Inf`).

- verbose:

  A logical. Whether to show `R5` informative messages when running the
  function. Defaults to `FALSE` (please note that in such case `R5`
  error messages are still shown). Setting `verbose` to `TRUE` shows
  detailed output, which can be useful for debugging issues not caught
  by `r5r`.

- progress:

  A logical. Whether to show a progress counter when running the router.
  Defaults to `FALSE`. Only works when `verbose` is set to `FALSE`, so
  the progress counter does not interfere with `R5`'s output messages.
  Setting `progress` to `TRUE` may impose a small penalty for
  computation efficiency, because the progress counter must be
  synchronized among all active threads.

## Value

A `"sf" "data.frame"` for each isochrone of each origin.

## Transport modes

`R5` allows for multiple combinations of transport modes. The options
include:

- **Transit modes:** `TRAM`, `SUBWAY`, `RAIL`, `BUS`, `FERRY`,
  `CABLE_CAR`, `GONDOLA`, `FUNICULAR`. The option `TRANSIT`
  automatically considers all public transport modes available.

- **Non transit modes:** `WALK`, `BICYCLE`, `CAR`, `BICYCLE_RENT`,
  `CAR_PARK`.

## Level of Traffic Stress (LTS)

When cycling is enabled in `R5` (by passing the value `BIKE` to either
`mode` or `mode_egress`), setting `max_lts` will allow cycling only on
streets with a given level of danger/stress. Setting `max_lts` to 1, for
example, will allow cycling only on separated bicycle infrastructure or
low-traffic streets and routing will revert to walking when traversing
any links with LTS exceeding 1. Setting `max_lts` to 3 will allow
cycling on links with LTS 1, 2 or 3. Routing also reverts to walking if
the street segment is tagged as non-bikable in OSM (e.g. a staircase),
independently of the specified max LTS.

The default methodology for assigning LTS values to network edges is
based on commonly tagged attributes of OSM ways. See more info about LTS
in the original documentation of R5 from Conveyal at
<https://docs.conveyal.com/learn-more/traffic-stress>. In summary:

- **LTS 1**: Tolerable for children. This includes low-speed, low-volume
  streets, as well as those with separated bicycle facilities (such as
  parking-protected lanes or cycle tracks).

- **LTS 2**: Tolerable for the mainstream adult population. This
  includes streets where cyclists have dedicated lanes and only have to
  interact with traffic at formal crossing.

- **LTS 3**: Tolerable for "enthused and confident" cyclists. This
  includes streets which may involve close proximity to moderate- or
  high-speed vehicular traffic.

- **LTS 4**: Tolerable only for "strong and fearless" cyclists. This
  includes streets where cyclists are required to mix with moderate- to
  high-speed vehicular traffic.

For advanced users, you can provide custom LTS values by adding a tag
`<key = "lts">` to the `osm.pbf` file.

## Datetime parsing

`r5r` ignores the timezone attribute of datetime objects when parsing
dates and times, using the study area's timezone instead. For example,
let's say you are running some calculations using Rio de Janeiro,
Brazil, as your study area. The datetime
`as.POSIXct("13-05-2019 14:00:00", format = "%d-%m-%Y %H:%M:%S")` will
be parsed as May 13th, 2019, 14:00h in Rio's local time, as expected.
But
`as.POSIXct("13-05-2019 14:00:00", format = "%d-%m-%Y %H:%M:%S", tz = "Europe/Paris")`
will also be parsed as the exact same date and time in Rio's local time,
perhaps surprisingly, ignoring the timezone attribute.

## Routing algorithm

The
[`travel_time_matrix()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/r5r/dev/reference/travel_time_matrix.md),
[`expanded_travel_time_matrix()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/r5r/dev/reference/expanded_travel_time_matrix.md),
[`arrival_travel_time_matrix()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/r5r/dev/reference/arrival_travel_time_matrix.md)
and
[`accessibility()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/r5r/dev/reference/accessibility.md)
functions use an `R5`-specific extension to the RAPTOR routing algorithm
(see Conway et al., 2017). This RAPTOR extension uses a systematic
sample of one departure per minute over the time window set by the user
in the 'time_window' parameter. A detailed description of base RAPTOR
can be found in Delling et al (2015). However, whenever the user
includes transit fares inputs to these functions, they automatically
switch to use an `R5`-specific extension to the McRAPTOR routing
algorithm.

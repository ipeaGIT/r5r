# r5r: Rapid Realistic Routing with 'R5'

Rapid realistic routing on multimodal transport networks (walk, bike,
public transport and car) using `R5`, the Rapid Realistic Routing on
Real-world and Reimagined networks engine
<https://github.com/conveyal/r5>. The package allows users to generate
detailed routing analysis or calculate travel time matrices using
seamless parallel computing on top of the R5 Java machine. While `R5` is
developed by Conveyal, the package `r5r` is independently developed by a
team at the Institute for Applied Economic Research (Ipea) with
contributions from collaborators. Apart from the documentation in this
package, users will find additional information on `R5` documentation at
<https://docs.conveyal.com/>. Although we try to keep new releases of
`r5r` in synchrony with `R5`, the development of `R5` follows Conveyal's
independent update process. Hence, users should confirm if the `R5`
version implied by the Conveyal user manual (see
<https://docs.conveyal.com/changelog>) corresponds with the `R5` version
that `r5r` depends on.

# Changelog

## r5r (development version)

**Major changes**

- Faster routing. In end-to-end benchmarks against r5r 2.4.0 on the
  Porto Alegre and São Paulo sample data, car-only
  [`travel_time_matrix()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/r5r/reference/travel_time_matrix.md),
  [`arrival_travel_time_matrix()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/r5r/reference/arrival_travel_time_matrix.md),
  [`accessibility()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/r5r/reference/accessibility.md)
  and
  [`pareto_frontier()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/r5r/reference/pareto_frontier.md)
  are 2 to 7 times faster (bicycle-only 2.5 to 4 times), and
  [`detailed_itineraries()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/r5r/reference/detailed_itineraries.md)
  with public transport and no `fare_structure` is 2 to 4 times faster.
  Details in the minor changes below.

**Bug fixes**

- Java memory set with `options(java.parameters = "-Xmx...")` before
  [`library(r5r)`](https://github.com/ipeaGIT/r5r) was ignored since r5r
  v2.2.0, so Java always ran with its default maximum heap (a quarter of
  the machine’s RAM, capped at about 30 GB). The memory limit and any
  other Java options set by the user now take effect again.
- [`travel_time_matrix()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/r5r/reference/travel_time_matrix.md),
  [`expanded_travel_time_matrix()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/r5r/reference/expanded_travel_time_matrix.md)
  and
  [`arrival_travel_time_matrix()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/r5r/reference/arrival_travel_time_matrix.md)
  returned `from_id` and `to_id` swapped with walk-only routing, no
  elevation data and fewer origins than destinations (introduced in r5r
  2.4.0). Closes again
  [\#501](https://github.com/ipeaGIT/r5r/issues/501).
- [\#569](https://github.com/ipeaGIT/r5r/pull/569) Fix broken source
  links in documentation website. Closed
  [\#527](https://github.com/ipeaGIT/r5r/issues/527)
- Origins/destinations passed as `sf` objects that also carried
  `lon`/`lat` (or `x`/`y`) attribute columns were routed using those
  attribute columns instead of the point geometry. The geometry is now
  always used.
- [`travel_time_matrix()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/r5r/reference/travel_time_matrix.md),
  [`arrival_travel_time_matrix()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/r5r/reference/arrival_travel_time_matrix.md)
  and
  [`expanded_travel_time_matrix()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/r5r/reference/expanded_travel_time_matrix.md)
  wrote CSV files with `from_id` and `to_id` swapped (and named after
  the destinations) when `output_dir` was used with walk-only routing,
  no elevation data and more origins than destinations. This is fixed,
  but such runs with `output_dir` may now take longer.
- `percentiles` are now sorted in ascending order internally. Unsorted
  values (e.g. `c(75, 25)`) used to crash inside R5 with an
  uninformative Java error.
- Origins/destinations with missing `lon`/`lat` coordinates now trigger
  a warning listing the affected ids. They used to be dropped silently.
- Origins/destinations with duplicated `id` values now raise an error in
  all one-to-many functions, instead of returning ambiguous duplicated
  rows.
  [`detailed_itineraries()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/r5r/reference/detailed_itineraries.md)
  keeps accepting repeated ids in row-paired inputs
  (`all_to_all = FALSE`).
- `FERRY` was missing from the list of transit modes that trigger the
  check for transit services on the departure date.
- `max_car_time` now caps car-only trips, as `max_walk_time` and
  `max_bike_time` already did for walk-only and bike-only trips. It used
  to apply only to car access/egress legs of transit trips.
- [`accessibility()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/r5r/reference/accessibility.md)
  with the `logistic`, `exponential` and `linear` decay functions
  ignored every trip longer than `max(cutoffs)`, although these curves
  still give weight to such trips, so accessibility was underestimated.
  `max_trip_duration` is now capped by `max(cutoffs)` only for the
  `step` function (the cap was introduced in r5r 2.1.0,
  [\#348](https://github.com/ipeaGIT/r5r/issues/348)). Results of the
  other decay functions change and are now larger.
- [`accessibility()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/r5r/reference/accessibility.md)
  now accepts fractional opportunity values (e.g. population
  interpolated onto a grid). They used to be truncated to integers, so
  any value below 1 counted as 0. Missing values are treated as 0, now
  with a warning, and infinite values raise an error.
- `cutoffs` in
  [`accessibility()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/r5r/reference/accessibility.md)
  are now validated (whole numbers between 1 and 120, no duplicates) and
  sorted in ascending order. Unsorted or out-of-range values used to
  crash inside R5 with an uninformative Java error, and duplicated
  values returned duplicated rows.
- In
  [`accessibility()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/r5r/reference/accessibility.md),
  the `decay_value` of the `linear` decay function is now required to be
  a whole number of minutes between 1 and 59. Fractional values used to
  be silently truncated by R5, and values of 60 or more crashed inside
  R5.
- [`detailed_itineraries()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/r5r/reference/detailed_itineraries.md)
  reported transfer-walk durations that differed from those used to find
  and rank itineraries. On networks built with elevation data this could
  give impossible timelines (e.g. 40 minutes to walk 119 m followed by a
  normal wait), itineraries longer than `max_trip_duration` and, with
  `shortest_path = TRUE`, an option that was not the shortest. Transfer
  walks now take walking distance / `walk_speed`, consistent with
  [`travel_time_matrix()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/r5r/reference/travel_time_matrix.md)
  and
  [`expanded_travel_time_matrix()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/r5r/reference/expanded_travel_time_matrix.md).
- In
  [`detailed_itineraries()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/r5r/reference/detailed_itineraries.md),
  transfer walks from or to the first stop of the transit network had a
  straight-line geometry and distance and no OSM or edge ids. They are
  now routed on the street network like all other transfers.
- CSV files written with `output_dir` did not quote text values, so any
  value containing a comma broke the file. This made every file written
  by
  [`detailed_itineraries()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/r5r/reference/detailed_itineraries.md)
  unreadable (its WKT `geometry` and its `osm_id_list` / `edge_id_list`
  columns always contain commas), and broke the files of any routing
  function when an id or route name contained a comma. Such values are
  now quoted following the CSV standard (RFC 4180); files without such
  values are unchanged.
- [`detailed_itineraries()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/r5r/reference/detailed_itineraries.md)
  with `output_dir` silently overwrote the file of a repeated
  origin-destination pair (allowed since row-paired inputs may repeat
  ids), and crashed with a Java error on ids containing characters not
  allowed in file names (e.g. `/`). It now raises an informative error
  in both cases.
- [`detailed_itineraries()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/r5r/reference/detailed_itineraries.md)
  with zero-row `origins` or `destinations` crashed inside Java. It now
  returns an empty result.
- A routing call that failed after a scenario (`new_carspeeds`,
  `carspeed_scale` or `new_lts`) had been applied left that scenario,
  and the other routing settings of the call, active in the routing
  engine, so the next call silently returned scenario results. All
  routing functions now reset the routing settings when they exit,
  including on error.
- A finite `max_fare` passed without a `fare_structure` now raises an
  error instead of being silently ignored.
- [`pareto_frontier()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/r5r/reference/pareto_frontier.md)
  failed when called without `fare_cutoffs`, because its default (`-1`)
  was rejected by the function’s own check that cutoffs are 0 or more.
  Without a `fare_structure` it ran but ignored fares, so its output was
  not a Pareto frontier. Both `fare_structure` and `fare_cutoffs` are
  now required arguments, with an informative error when either is
  missing. Code that passed `fare_structure = NULL` (or left it out) now
  raises an error.
- Integer arguments (`max_walk_time`, `max_bike_time`, `max_car_time`,
  `max_trip_duration`, `time_window`, `percentiles`, `n_threads`,
  `max_rides`, `max_lts`, `draws_per_minute`, `cutoffs`,
  `suboptimal_minutes`, and `zoom` in
  [`isochrone()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/r5r/reference/isochrone.md))
  now reject non-integer values instead of silently truncating them.
- Polygon-based isochrones from
  [`isochrone()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/r5r/reference/isochrone.md)
  were shifted by half a grid cell to the north-west (about 94 m at the
  default `zoom = 10` in Porto Alegre), because R5’s travel times,
  computed at the centre of each Web Mercator pixel, were placed at the
  pixel’s corner. Polygons are now in the right place.
- In polygon-based
  [`isochrone()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/r5r/reference/isochrone.md),
  the polygon of the largest cutoff was cut short, so its size depended
  on the other cutoffs requested (e.g. the 30-minute transit isochrone
  was up to 19% smaller with `cutoffs = 30` than with
  `cutoffs = c(30, 60)`). It is now complete, so the largest polygons
  get larger (routing now runs 10 minutes past the largest cutoff).
- Line-based
  [`isochrone()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/r5r/reference/isochrone.md)
  (`polygon_output = FALSE`) assigned segments to the wrong band when
  `cutoffs` were not in ascending order, and crashed with duplicated
  `cutoffs`. `cutoffs` are now sorted and deduplicated, and must be
  finite, non-missing and include a value greater than 0.
- Line-based
  [`isochrone()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/r5r/reference/isochrone.md)
  now returns an `id` column with the origin id, so results for several
  origins can be told apart. The `id` column is now always character in
  both outputs (it used to keep the input type in polygon output), and
  the `st_centroid` warning on every line-based call is gone.
- [`arrival_travel_time_matrix()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/r5r/reference/arrival_travel_time_matrix.md)
  searched departures in the wrong time window for walk-, bike- or
  car-only trips when `max_walk_time`, `max_bike_time` or `max_car_time`
  was lower than `max_trip_duration`. Trips arrived well before
  `arrival_datetime` (e.g. with `mode = "WALK"`,
  `max_trip_duration = 120` and `max_walk_time = 20`, departures between
  12:00 and 12:19 for an arrival at 14:00, instead of between 13:40 and
  13:59).
- [`build_network()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/r5r/reference/build_network.md)
  now detects and aborts with an informative message when a cached
  `network.dat` triggers a silent internal rebuild that fails on high
  priority GTFS errors, instead of silently returning an unusable
  `r5r_network` that only fails later with an opaque
  `NullPointerException` on the first routing call.
- With `output_dir`, the CSV files written by
  [`travel_time_matrix()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/r5r/reference/travel_time_matrix.md),
  [`expanded_travel_time_matrix()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/r5r/reference/expanded_travel_time_matrix.md)
  and
  [`arrival_travel_time_matrix()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/r5r/reference/arrival_travel_time_matrix.md)
  held `2147483647` and a `[WALK]` route for trips longer than
  `max_trip_duration`, where the in-memory result has `NA`. These cells
  are now empty fields, so the files match the in-memory result.
- [`expanded_travel_time_matrix()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/r5r/reference/expanded_travel_time_matrix.md)
  and
  [`arrival_travel_time_matrix()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/r5r/reference/arrival_travel_time_matrix.md)
  failed with walk-only routing, no elevation data and more than 5000
  origins, even with 5000 or fewer destinations (R5’s limit for path
  details). This now works.
- Java errors raised while routing now reach R with their original
  message (e.g. R5’s 5000-destination limit for path details) instead of
  an empty `java.lang.RuntimeException`.
- [`expanded_travel_time_matrix()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/r5r/reference/expanded_travel_time_matrix.md)
  and
  [`arrival_travel_time_matrix()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/r5r/reference/arrival_travel_time_matrix.md)
  mixed up public transport trips departing at exactly 00:00:00 with
  walk-, bike- or car-only trips: the first minute returned extra rows
  with an empty `departure_time`. Each departure minute now has one row
  per draw.
- [`arrival_travel_time_matrix()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/r5r/reference/arrival_travel_time_matrix.md)
  stopped searching earlier departures at the first minute with no trip,
  so pairs that could still arrive in time by leaving earlier were
  missing (7 of 221 pairs among the Porto Alegre points of interest). It
  also compared arrivals using durations rounded to 0.1 minute, which
  accepted trips up to 3 seconds late and could reject trips arriving on
  time; it now uses the exact duration.
- Leg geometries of
  [`detailed_itineraries()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/r5r/reference/detailed_itineraries.md)
  repeated a vertex at every intermediate public transport stop (and in
  some walk legs), so
  [`sf::st_is_valid()`](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/reference/valid.html)
  returned `FALSE` under s2. Repeated consecutive vertices are now
  removed; shapes and `distance` are unchanged.

**Minor changes**

- Car-only and bicycle-only routing in
  [`travel_time_matrix()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/r5r/reference/travel_time_matrix.md),
  [`expanded_travel_time_matrix()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/r5r/reference/expanded_travel_time_matrix.md),
  [`arrival_travel_time_matrix()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/r5r/reference/arrival_travel_time_matrix.md),
  [`accessibility()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/r5r/reference/accessibility.md)
  and
  [`pareto_frontier()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/r5r/reference/pareto_frontier.md)
  is 2.5 to 4 times faster in a benchmark of this change alone (part of
  the overall gain in Major changes), as r5r no longer runs an unneeded
  search on foot. Bicycle results are unchanged. Car-only trips can no
  longer end with a walk not limited by `max_walk_time` (e.g. against a
  one-way street), so some car travel times are now longer (3% of
  origin-destination pairs in the Porto Alegre sample data, by 1 to 8
  minutes), now consistent with
  [`isochrone()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/r5r/reference/isochrone.md).
- [`travel_time_matrix()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/r5r/reference/travel_time_matrix.md),
  [`expanded_travel_time_matrix()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/r5r/reference/expanded_travel_time_matrix.md)
  and
  [`arrival_travel_time_matrix()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/r5r/reference/arrival_travel_time_matrix.md)
  return large results faster: passing an all-to-all matrix of the Porto
  Alegre sample grid (1.47 million rows) from Java to R went from 0.76
  to 0.13 seconds. Results are unchanged.
- [`detailed_itineraries()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/r5r/reference/detailed_itineraries.md)
  with public transport and no `fare_structure` is about 1.5 times
  faster with `max_trip_duration = 60`, 2.4 times faster with
  `time_window = 30`, and about 4 times faster with the defaults
  (`max_trip_duration = 120`, `shortest_path = TRUE`), and uses less
  memory. The itineraries returned are unchanged, except that with
  `suboptimal_minutes > 0` the `option` numbers of two itineraries with
  exactly the same duration and number of segments can be swapped.
  Routing with a `fare_structure` is unchanged.
- The deprecated `r5r_core` argument is now the last argument of every
  function. It used to be the second one, so positional calls such as
  `travel_time_matrix(r5r_network, origins, destinations)` bound
  `origins` to `r5r_core` and failed with a misleading deprecation
  warning and error.
- Documentation fixes: `carspeed_scale` defaults to `1` (not `NULL`),
  and the unsupported modes `BICYCLE_RENT` and `CAR_PARK` were removed
  from the list of transport modes.
- The documentation of
  [`detailed_itineraries()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/r5r/reference/detailed_itineraries.md)
  now lists the output columns and how itinerary options are ordered,
  and describes the `osm_link_ids` columns correctly (`board_stop_id`
  and `alight_stop_id` are feed-prefixed GTFS stop ids, not OSM ids;
  `edge_id_list` is also added). It also explains that
  `shortest_path = TRUE` picks the itinerary with the shortest travel
  time among all departures within `time_window` (not the earliest
  arrival), and that `suboptimal_minutes` requires
  `shortest_path = FALSE` and no `fare_structure`.
- The documentation of
  [`detailed_itineraries()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/r5r/reference/detailed_itineraries.md)
  and the time window vignette now explain how `time_window` and
  `suboptimal_minutes` select itineraries. Departures are simulated at
  random seconds (about one per minute, the same in every call from the
  same origin) and routed separately, and for each departure only routes
  arriving within `suboptimal_minutes` of the earliest arrival are kept,
  even if a slower route has fewer transfers. As a result, an itinerary
  can appear or disappear when the departure time changes by one minute.
  Closed [\#534](https://github.com/ipeaGIT/r5r/issues/534).
- The documentation of
  [`arrival_travel_time_matrix()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/r5r/reference/arrival_travel_time_matrix.md)
  now describes its output correctly (one row per pair reachable in
  time, with the latest departure; other pairs are absent), explains
  that `max_trip_duration` also sets the search window, and documents
  `"24:MM:SS"` departure times after midnight and the whole-minute
  precision of walk-, bike- or car-only trips.
- The documentation of
  [`expanded_travel_time_matrix()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/r5r/reference/expanded_travel_time_matrix.md)
  now lists the output columns, explains `routes`, that the
  `breakdown = TRUE` time components are `0` for trips without public
  transport, why a pair can be `NA` in every minute and why a few trips
  just over `max_trip_duration` are `NA` here although
  [`travel_time_matrix()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/r5r/reference/travel_time_matrix.md)
  reports them, and no longer claims that `time_window` results use
  median travel times or that `breakdown = TRUE` is significantly
  slower.
- The documentation of
  [`isochrone()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/r5r/reference/isochrone.md)
  now describes the Web Mercator grid method, the output columns
  (polygon bands are cumulative, line bands are intervals), the right
  defaults of `mode` and `progress`, and that `max_trip_duration` is
  ignored (set from `max(cutoffs)`); the isochrones vignette was
  corrected to match.
- The documentation of the `fixed_exponential` decay function in
  [`accessibility()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/r5r/reference/accessibility.md)
  now states that its decay constant is applied to travel times in
  seconds, so per-minute constants must be divided by 60.
- [\#571](https://github.com/ipeaGIT/r5r/pull/571) Update logging when
  building GTFS network with multiple feeds.
- [\#568](https://github.com/ipeaGIT/r5r/pull/568) Update logging for
  direct trip router. Closed
  [\#557](https://github.com/ipeaGIT/r5r/issues/557)

## r5r 2.4.0

CRAN release: 2026-05-20

**Major changes**

- Using new version of R5 v7.5.1. Closed
  [\#373](https://github.com/ipeaGIT/r5r/issues/373) and
  [\#970](https://github.com/conveyal/r5/issues/970)
- The
  [`isochrone()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/r5r/reference/isochrone.md)
  function has gone through major changes which substantially improved
  polygon-based isochrones. The function now builds on top of a travel
  time surface that uses a regular grid of points across the network
  (specifically a grid of Web Mercator pixels) and then uses the
  marching squares algorithm to generate the isochrone polygons. See
  detailed in the updated vignette. Closed
  [\#455](https://github.com/ipeaGIT/r5r/issues/455) and Closed
  [\#495](https://github.com/ipeaGIT/r5r/issues/495).
- New support function
  [`get_gtfs_errors()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/r5r/reference/get_gtfs_errors.md)
  to help diagnose eventual errors in the GTFS data that prevent
  building the network. Closed
  [\#431](https://github.com/ipeaGIT/r5r/issues/431) and
  [\#541](https://github.com/ipeaGIT/r5r/issues/541).

**Minor changes**

- New support function
  [`check_transit_availability()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/r5r/reference/check_transit_availability.md)
  that checks the number and proportion of public transport services
  from the GTFS feeds that are active on specified dates.
- New support function
  [`street_network_bbox()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/r5r/reference/street_network_bbox.md)
  that efficiently extracts the geographic bounding box of the transport
  network.
- More informative messages in case of Java error in R5. Closed
  [\#515](https://github.com/ipeaGIT/r5r/issues/515).
- When direct routing fails the log now mentions the name of the origin
  and destination points to help the user debug. Closed
  [\#519](https://github.com/ipeaGIT/r5r/issues/519).

**Bug fixes**

- Revert back the order of origins destinations for Direct Modes. Fix
  implemented `in travel_time_matrix()`,
  [`arrival_travel_time_matrix()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/r5r/reference/arrival_travel_time_matrix.md)
  and
  [`expanded_travel_time_matrix()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/r5r/reference/expanded_travel_time_matrix.md).
  Closes [\#501](https://github.com/ipeaGIT/r5r/issues/501).
- Reverse search optimization is now only applicable to walking. Closes
  [\#517](https://github.com/ipeaGIT/r5r/issues/517).
- r5r now uses walking speed from request location to snapped point on
  the road network. This was a fix upstream in R5. Closed
  [\#373](https://github.com/ipeaGIT/r5r/issues/373)
- Elevation data does not affect carspeeds anymore. This was a fix
  upstream in R5. Closed
  [\#970](https://github.com/conveyal/r5/issues/970)
- Fixed a bug that was introduced in r5r {2.3.0} and which led to ignore
  elevation when building the network. Closed
  [\#555](https://github.com/conveyal/r5/issues/555). Elevation data is
  still ignored when creating scenarios of LTS, but this is a know bug
  that will throw warning messages while we work a way to fix it in a
  future update.

**New contributors to r5r**

- [Egor Kotov](https://github.com/e-kotov)

## r5r 2.3.0

CRAN release: 2025-08-21

**Major changes**

- New function
  [`build_network()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/r5r/reference/build_network.md)
  to replace
  [`setup_r5()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/r5r/reference/setup_r5.md),
  which is being deprecated. Idiomatically `r5r_core` is now
  `r5r_network`.
- New function
  [`arrival_travel_time_matrix()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/r5r/reference/arrival_travel_time_matrix.md)
  to calculate travel time matrix between origin destination pairs
  considering the time of arrival, instead of a depature time. Closes
  [\#291](https://github.com/ipeaGIT/r5r/issues/291)
- We have now implemented a reverse search optimization for direct
  transport modes (walking and cycling) in the functions
  [`travel_time_matrix()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/r5r/reference/travel_time_matrix.md),
  [`expanded_travel_time_matrix()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/r5r/reference/expanded_travel_time_matrix.md)
  and
  [`arrival_travel_time_matrix()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/r5r/reference/arrival_travel_time_matrix.md).
  In practice, this means that these functions are now much faster when
  there are multiple origins to few destinations but only when there is
  no elevation `.tif` file in the data path. Closes
  [\#450](https://github.com/ipeaGIT/r5r/issues/450)
- All routing and accessibility functions in `r5r` have new parameters
  `new_carspeeds`, `carspeed_scale` and `new_lts` which allow one to use
  custom car speeds and LTS levels for cycling. These parameters provide
  convient and efficient ways to build different scenarios of traffic
  congestion, road closure and interventions in cycling infrastructure.
  Closes [\#289](https://github.com/ipeaGIT/r5r/issues/289)

**Minor changes**

- The routable transport network built with
  [`build_network()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/r5r/reference/build_network.md)
  and
  [`setup_r5()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/r5r/reference/setup_r5.md)
  now have their own class `"r5r_network"`, making the package more
  consistent and safer from errors
  [\#472](https://github.com/ipeaGIT/r5r/pull/472).
- Routing properties within r5r jar (aka little jar) are reset to
  default after a routing execution
  [\#453](https://github.com/ipeaGIT/r5r/pull/453)
- Less cluttering messages in r5r dialogue. Removed logback startup
  messages. `Verbose=F` now completly silences java output. `Verbose=T`
  only reports messages up to INFO level as opposed to up to DEBUG
  [\#456](https://github.com/ipeaGIT/r5r/pull/456).
- Removed date from r5r-log. You no longer have to delete the previous
  day’s log! [\#456](https://github.com/ipeaGIT/r5r/pull/456)
- Improved warning and error messages.
- r5r developers can now set `options(r5r.r5jar=...)` to use a local JAR
  instead of the R5 jar downloaded by r5r.

**Bug fixes**

- Fixed a bug where `network_settings.json` wasn’t showing the right
  version numbers [\#459](https://github.com/ipeaGIT/r5r/pull/459).
  Version number now dynamically updated
  [\#456](https://github.com/ipeaGIT/r5r/pull/456).

## r5r 2.2.0

CRAN release: 2025-05-22

**Major changes**

- r5r now uses the latest version of R5 V7.4. Closed
  [\#436](https://github.com/ipeaGIT/r5r/issues/436)
- The
  [`detailed_itineraries()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/r5r/reference/detailed_itineraries.md)
  now has a new parameter `osm_link_ids`. A logical. Whether the output
  should include the additional columns with the OSM ids of the road
  segments used along the trip geometry Defaults to `FALSE`. Closes
  issues [\#298](https://github.com/ipeaGIT/r5r/issues/298)

**Minor changes**

- r5r now throws an informative error message when the geographic extent
  of input data exceeds limit of 975000 km2. Closes issues \#389, \#405,
  \#406, \#407, \#412 and \#421. Thanks to PR \#426 by Alex Magnus.
- removed JRI dependency in r5r little jar. This helps debugging issues
  in Java without the need of using R. The side effect is that r5r now
  creates an `r5rlog` file in the data path.

**Bug fixes**

- Fixed a bug that prevented the package to check the availability of
  transit services in specific days when there is no service at all.
- Fixed a bug in the isochrone function that was throwing false error
  message regarding cutoff being too short. Closed
  [\#434](https://github.com/ipeaGIT/r5r/issues/434) and
  [\#433](https://github.com/ipeaGIT/r5r/issues/433)

## r5r 2.1.0

CRAN release: 2025-03-08

**Minor changes**

- The
  [`isochrone()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/r5r/reference/isochrone.md)
  function has a new boolean parameter `polygon_output` that allows
  users to choose whether the output should be a polygon- or line-based
  isochrone. Closed [\#382](https://github.com/ipeaGIT/r5r/issues/382)
- When using public transit modes, the package now automatically detects
  whether there are any transit services operation on the seleced
  departure date. If there are no services, the package will return an
  error message. Closed
  [\#326](https://github.com/ipeaGIT/r5r/issues/326)

## r5r 2.0

CRAN release: 2024-04-11

  [\#350](https://github.com/ipeaGIT/r5r/issues/350).
- r5r now uses the latest version of R5 V7.1. Closed
  [\#350](https://github.com/ipeaGIT/r5r/issues/350)

**Major changes**

- r5r now stores R5 Jar file at user dir using
  [`tools::R_user_dir()`](https://rdrr.io/r/tools/userdir.html)
- New function
  [`r5r_cache()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/r5r/reference/r5r_cache.md)
  to manage the cache of the R5 Jar file.
- By using the JDK 21, this version of r5r also fixed an incompatibility
  with MAC ARM processors. Closed
  [\#315](https://github.com/ipeaGIT/r5r/issues/315)

**Minor changes**

- In the
  [`accessibility()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/r5r/reference/accessibility.md)
  function, the value of `max_trip_duration` is now capped by the max
  value passed to the `cutoffs` parameter. Closes
  [\#348](https://github.com/ipeaGIT/r5r/issues/348).
- Updated documentation of parameter `max_walk_time` to make it clear
  that in walk-only trips, whenever `max_walk_time` differs from
  `max_trip_duration`, the lowest value is considered. Closes
  [\#353](https://github.com/ipeaGIT/r5r/issues/353)
- Updated documentation of parameter `max_bike_time` to make it clear
  that in bicycle-only trips, whenever `max_bike_time` differs from
  `max_trip_duration`, the lowest value is considered. Closes
  [\#353](https://github.com/ipeaGIT/r5r/issues/353)
- Improved documentation of parameter `suboptimal_minutes` in the
  [`detailed_itineraries()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/r5r/reference/detailed_itineraries.md)
  function.
- Updated the vignette on time window to explain how this parameter
  behaves when used in the
  [`detailed_itineraries()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/r5r/reference/detailed_itineraries.md)
  function.

**Bug Fixes**

- Fixed bug that prevented the use the `output_dir` parameter in the
  `detailed_itineraries(all_to_all = TRUE)` function. Closes
  [\#327](https://github.com/ipeaGIT/r5r/issues/327) with a contribution
  ([PR \#354](https://github.com/ipeaGIT/r5r/pull/354)) from Luyu Liu.
- Fixed bug that prevented `detailed_itineraries` from working with
  frequency-based GTFS feeds. It should ONLY work with frequency-based
  GTFS feeds.

**New contributors to r5r**

- [Luyu Liu](https://github.com/luyuliu)

## r5r 1.1.0

CRAN release: 2023-08-08

**Major changes**

- New
  [`isochrone()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/r5r/reference/isochrone.md)function.
  Closes [\#123](https://github.com/ipeaGIT/r5r/issues/123), and
  addresses requrests in issues
  [\#164](https://github.com/ipeaGIT/r5r/issues/164) and
  [\#328](https://github.com/ipeaGIT/r5r/issues/328).
- New vignette about calculating / visualizing isochrones with `r5r`.
- New vignette with responses to frequently asked questions (FAQ) from
  `r5r` users.

**Minor changes**

- The default value of `time_window` is not set to `10` minutes in all
  functions to avoid weird results reported upstream in R5. Closes
  [\#342](https://github.com/ipeaGIT/r5r/issues/342).
- Removed any mention to `percentiles` parameter in the
  [`expanded_travel_time_matrix()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/r5r/reference/expanded_travel_time_matrix.md)
  because this function does not expose this parameter to users. Closes
  [\#343](https://github.com/ipeaGIT/r5r/issues/343).
- Updated vignette on calculating / visualizing accessibility with
  `r5r`.

## r5r 1.0.1

CRAN release: 2023-03-06

**Bug fixes**

- Updated to R5 version 6.9. This fixed a few bugs upstream, one of
  which often prevented users to build a network using cropped OSM data.
  Closes [\#325](https://github.com/ipeaGIT/r5r/issues/325).

## r5r 1.0.0

CRAN release: 2023-01-27

**Breaking changes**

- Replaced `max_walk_dist` and `max_bike_dist` parameters with
  `max_walk_time` and `max_bike_time` to better align with R5 inputs.
  Closes [\#273](https://github.com/ipeaGIT/r5r/issues/273).
- `r5r` now uses `R5`’s native elevation weighting for walking and
  cycling impedance functions. As a result `r5r` does not have raster or
  rgdal package dependencies anymore. Closes
  [\#243](https://github.com/ipeaGIT/r5r/issues/243) and
  [\#233](https://github.com/ipeaGIT/r5r/issues/233).
- Parameters `breakdown` and `breakdown_stat` in
  [`travel_time_matrix()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/r5r/reference/travel_time_matrix.md)
  were removed. New function
  [`expanded_travel_time_matrix()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/r5r/reference/expanded_travel_time_matrix.md)
  should be used to retrieve detailed information of travel time
  matrices.
- `r5r`now throws an error if users simultaneously pass more than one of
  the following modes `c('WALK','CAR','BICYCLE')` to the
  `transport_mode` parameter. This is because these modes are understood
  as mutually exclusive.
- Function
  [`setup_r5()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/r5r/reference/setup_r5.md) no
  longer has a `version` parameter.

**New functions**

- New function
  [`expanded_travel_time_matrix()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/r5r/reference/expanded_travel_time_matrix.md)
  to calculate minute-by-minute travel times between origin destination
  pairs and get additional information on public transport routes,
  number of transfers, and total access, waiting, in-vehicle and
  transfer times.
- New function
  [`pareto_frontier()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/r5r/reference/pareto_frontier.md)
  to compute of travel time and monetary cost Pareto frontier.
- New function
  [`r5r_sitrep()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/r5r/reference/r5r_sitrep.md)
  to generate an `r5r` situation report to help debug code errors
- New functions to account for monetary costs:
  - [`setup_fare_structure()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/r5r/reference/setup_fare_structure.md)
    to setup a fare structure to calculate the monetary costs of trips
  - [`read_fare_structure()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/r5r/reference/read_fare_structure.md)
    to read a fare structure object from a file
  - [`write_fare_structure()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/r5r/reference/write_fare_structure.md)
    to write a fare structure object to disk

**Major changes**

- Now using R5 latest version `6.8`.
- The
  [`detailed_itineraries()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/r5r/reference/detailed_itineraries.md)
  has been substantially improved. The new vesion is faster than
  previous ones. It also includes new parameters listed below. Closes
  [\#265](https://github.com/ipeaGIT/r5r/issues/265).
  - New `time_window` parameter
  - New `suboptimal_minutes` parameter, which extends the search space
    and returns a larger number of trips beyond the fastest ones;
  - Support for fare calculator and new `max_fare` parameter;
  - Routing in frequencies GFTS, including support for Monte Carlo draws
- New parameter `draws_per_minute` to
  [`travel_time_matrix()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/r5r/reference/travel_time_matrix.md),
  [`accessibility()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/r5r/reference/accessibility.md)
  and
  [`pareto_frontier()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/r5r/reference/pareto_frontier.md)
  functions. Closes [\#230](https://github.com/ipeaGIT/r5r/issues/230).
- New parameter `output_dir` to all routing functions, which can be used
  to specify a directory in which the results should be saved as `.csv`
  files (one file for each origin). This parameter is particularly
  useful when running estimates on memory-constrained settings, because
  writing the results to disk prevents `R5` from storing them in memory.
- The accessibility estimates from
  [`accessibility()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/r5r/reference/accessibility.md)
  are now of returned as doubles / class `numeric`, except when using a
  `step` decay function. Closes
  [\#235](https://github.com/ipeaGIT/r5r/issues/235).
- The
  [`detailed_itineraries()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/r5r/reference/detailed_itineraries.md)
  function has a new parameter `all_to_all`, which allows users to set
  whether they want to query routes between all origins to all
  destinations (`all_to_all = TRUE`) or to query routes between the 1st
  origin to the 1st destination, then the 2nd origin to the 2nd
  destination, and so on (`all_to_all = FALSE`, the default). Closes
  [\#224](https://github.com/ipeaGIT/r5r/issues/224).

**Minor changes**

- Package documentation has been extensively updated and expanded.
- Improved documentation of the `cutoffs` parameter in
  [`accessibility()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/r5r/reference/accessibility.md),
  clarifying the function only accepts up to 12 cutoff values. Closes
  [\#216](https://github.com/ipeaGIT/r5r/issues/216).
- Improved documentation of the `percentiles` parameter in
  [`accessibility()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/r5r/reference/accessibility.md)
  and
  [`travel_time_matrix()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/r5r/reference/travel_time_matrix.md),
  clarifying these function only accepts up to 5 values. Closes
  [\#246](https://github.com/ipeaGIT/r5r/issues/246).
- r5r now downloads R5 Jar directly from Conveyal’s github, making the
  package more stable. Closes
  [\#226](https://github.com/ipeaGIT/r5r/issues/226).
- All functions now use `verbose = FALSE` and `progress = FALSE` by
  default.
- Routing functions now require users to be non-ambiguous when
  specifying the modes, raising errors when it cannot disambiguate them.
  This new behaviour replaces the old one, in which the functions could
  end up trying to “guess” which mode was to be used in some edge cases.
- Information on bicycle ‘level of traffic stress’ is now added to the
  output of
  [`street_network_to_sf()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/r5r/reference/street_network_to_sf.md).
  Closes [\#251](https://github.com/ipeaGIT/r5r/issues/251).
- New columns with info on population, schools and jobs in the example
  data sets for Sao Paulo and Porto Alegre

**Bug fixes**

- Fixed bug that
  [`transit_network_to_sf()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/r5r/reference/transit_network_to_sf.md)
  generated some routes with invalid geometries. Closes
  [\#256](https://github.com/ipeaGIT/r5r/issues/256).
- Fixed bug that prevented `setup_r5(path, overwrite = TRUE)` to work.

## r5r 0.7.1

CRAN release: 2022-07-05

**Minor change**

- Replaced the akima package with interp package in r5r Suggests, as
  requested by CRAN.

## r5r 0.7.0

CRAN release: 2022-02-11

**Major changes**

- From this version onwards, r5r downloads R5 JAR from github, which
  provides more stable connection than Ipea server.
- The number of Monte Carlo draws to perform per time window minute when
  calculating travel time matrices and when estimating accessibility is
  now set via the `r5r.montecarlo_draws` option. Defaults to 5. This
  would mean 300 draws in a 60 minutes time window, for example. The
  user may also set a custom value using
  `options(r5r.montecarlo_draws = 10L)` (in which you substitute 10L by
  the value you want to set).

**Minor changes**

- Changed `total_time` column name to `combined_time` in
  [`travel_time_matrix()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/r5r/reference/travel_time_matrix.md)
  output, to avoid confusion with `travel_time` column.

## r5r 0.6.0

CRAN release: 2021-10-26

**Major changes**

- Updated R5 to version 6.4. Closes
  [\#182](https://github.com/ipeaGIT/r5r/issues/182).

- Significant performance improvements in all functions, due to a faster
  method for consolidating outputs. Closes
  [\#180](https://github.com/ipeaGIT/r5r/issues/180)

- New function
  [`transit_network_to_sf()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/r5r/reference/transit_network_to_sf.md),
  to extract the public transport network from R5 as simple features.
  Closes [\#179](https://github.com/ipeaGIT/r5r/issues/179)

- New `progress` parameter in the
  [`accessibility()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/r5r/reference/accessibility.md),
  `travel_time_matrix`, and
  [`detailed_itineraries()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/r5r/reference/detailed_itineraries.md)
  functions, to show or hide the progress counter indicator. Closes
  [\#186](https://github.com/ipeaGIT/r5r/issues/186)

- Created new support function
  [`java_to_dt()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/r5r/reference/java_to_dt.md)
  and removed dependency on the `jdx` package. Closes
  [\#206](https://github.com/ipeaGIT/r5r/issues/206)

- Reduced r5r’s internet dependency quite considerably. Internet is now
  only required to download the latest R5 jar if it hasn’t been
  downloaded before. Closes
  [\#197](https://github.com/ipeaGIT/r5r/issues/197).

- Added two new parameters `breakdown` and `breakdown_stat` to the
  [`travel_time_matrix()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/r5r/reference/travel_time_matrix.md).
  This allows users to breakdown the travel time information by trip
  subcomponents (access time, waiting time, traveling time etc). It
  allows one to extract more information but it makes computation time
  slower. Closes [\#194](https://github.com/ipeaGIT/r5r/issues/194)

**Minor changes**

- New
  [`setup_r5()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/r5r/reference/setup_r5.md)
  parameter, `overwrite`, that forces the building of a new
  `network.dat`, even if one already exists.
- Improved documentation of parameter `departure_datetime` to clarify
  the parameter must be set to local time. Closes
  [\#188](https://github.com/ipeaGIT/r5r/issues/188)
- Improved documentation regarding personalized LTS values. [Closes
  \#190](https://github.com/ipeaGIT/r5r/issues/190).
- Improved documentation of
  [`transit_network_to_sf()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/r5r/reference/transit_network_to_sf.md)
  regarding stops that are not snapped to road network. [Closes
  \#192](https://github.com/ipeaGIT/r5r/issues/192).
- Improved documentation of `max_walking_dist` and `max_cycling_dist`
  parameters. [Closes \#193](https://github.com/ipeaGIT/r5r/issues/193).
- Started raising an error if the CRS of origins/destinations is not
  WGS 84. Closes [\#201](https://github.com/ipeaGIT/r5r/issues/201).

## r5r 0.5.0

CRAN release: 2021-07-02

**Major changes**

- New function
  [`accessibility()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/r5r/reference/accessibility.md)
  to calculate access to opportunities. Closes
  [\#169](https://github.com/ipeaGIT/r5r/issues/169)

- New function
  [`find_snap()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/r5r/reference/find_snap.md)
  to help users identify where in the street network the input of origin
  and destination points are snapped to. Closes
  [168](https://github.com/ipeaGIT/r5r/issues/168).

- New parameter `max_bike_dist` added to routing and accessibility
  functions. Closes [\#174](https://github.com/ipeaGIT/r5r/issues/174)

- Implemented temporary solution for elevation. Closes
  [\#171](https://github.com/ipeaGIT/r5r/issues/171). Now r5r can read
  Digital Elevation Model (DEM) data from raster files in `.tif` format
  to weight the street network for walking and cycling according to the
  terrain’s slopes. Ideally, we would like to see a solution that
  accounts for elevation implemented upstream in R5. For now, this is a
  temporary solution implemented within r5r.

**Minor changes**

- The
  [`street_network_to_sf()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/r5r/reference/street_network_to_sf.md)
  now has a more clean output when the provided GTFS covers a larger
  area than the street network pbf. Closes
  [\#173](https://github.com/ipeaGIT/r5r/issues/173)

- The size of poa.zip sample GTFS data has been reduced due to CRAN
  policies. Closes [\#172](https://github.com/ipeaGIT/r5r/issues/172).

- Progress counter Implemented. Closes
  [150](https://github.com/ipeaGIT/r5r/issues/150). When the `verbose`
  parameter is set to `FALSE`, r5r prints a progress counter and
  eventual `ERROR` messages. This comes with a minor penalty for
  computation performance. Hence we have kept `verbose` defautls to
  `TRUE`.

**Bug fixes**

- Fixed bug that prevented r5r from running without internet connection.
  Closes [\#163](https://github.com/ipeaGIT/r5r/issues/163).

## r5r 0.4-0

**Major changes**

- Updated R5 to version 6.2. Closes
  [\#158](https://github.com/ipeaGIT/r5r/issues/158).
- Added `max_lts` parameter to
  [`detailed_itineraries()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/r5r/reference/detailed_itineraries.md)
  and
  [`travel_time_matrix()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/r5r/reference/travel_time_matrix.md)
  functions. LTS stands for Level of Traffic Stress, and allows modeling
  of bicycle comfort in routing analysis. Additional information can be
  found in [Conveyal’s
  documentation](https://docs.conveyal.com/learn-more/traffic-stress).

**Minor changes**

- New support function `check_connection()` to check internect
  connection before download files from Ipea server.

## r5r 0.3-3

CRAN release: 2021-03-09

**Major changes**

- New vignette to [calculate and visualize
  isochrones](https://ipeagit.github.io/r5r/articles/isochrones.html).

  accessibility](https://ipeagit.github.io/r5r/articles/accessibility.html).
- Significant performance increase in
  [`detailed_itineraries()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/r5r/reference/detailed_itineraries.md)
  when `shortest_path = TRUE`. Closes
  [\#153](https://github.com/ipeaGIT/r5r/issues/153).
- [Paper on the r5r package published on
  **Findings**](https://doi.org/10.32866/001c.21262). Closes
  [\#108](https://github.com/ipeaGIT/r5r/issues/108).

**Minor changes**

- [`travel_time_matrix()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/r5r/reference/travel_time_matrix.md)
  and
  [`detailed_itineraries()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/r5r/reference/detailed_itineraries.md)
  now output more detailed messages in the console, when
  `verbose = TRUE`. This shall make debugging the package much easier.
- Improved documentation of
  [`travel_time_matrix()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/r5r/reference/travel_time_matrix.md).
  Closes [\#149](https://github.com/ipeaGIT/r5r/issues/149).
- Checks origins/destinations inputs to make sure they have and `id`
  column. Closes [\#154](https://github.com/ipeaGIT/r5r/issues/154).

**Bug fixes**

- Fixed [introductory
  vignette](https://ipeagit.github.io/r5r/articles/r5r.html) to list
  only files that are included in the package installation. Closes
  [\#111](https://github.com/ipeaGIT/r5r/issues/111).
- Fixed conflict with [geobr](https://ipea.github.io/geobr/) package
  when downloading metadata. Closed
  [\#137](https://github.com/ipeaGIT/r5r/issues/137).
- Fixed a bug when when parsing date and time from `departure_datetime`
  in
  [`detailed_itineraries()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/r5r/reference/detailed_itineraries.md)
  and
  [`travel_time_matrix()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/r5r/reference/travel_time_matrix.md).
  Closes [\#147](https://github.com/ipeaGIT/r5r/issues/147).
- Fixed a bug in
  [`detailed_itineraries()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/r5r/reference/detailed_itineraries.md)
  that caused a crash when the shape of a route in the input GTFS is
  broken. Closes [\#145](https://github.com/ipeaGIT/r5r/issues/145)

## r5r 0.3-2

CRAN release: 2021-01-08

**Minor changes**

- r5r does not save the medatada file in the package directory anymore,
  following CRAN’s policies. Closed \#136.

CRAN release: 2021-01-07

**Minor changes**

- Allow for combination of bicycle and public transport. Closed \#135.
- Added new parameter `mode_egress` to routing functions, so that users
  can explicitly set the transport mode used after egress from public
  transport (walk, car or bicycle). Closed \#63.
- Allow for using the r5r package off-line, provided the user has
  successfully ran
  [`setup_r5()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/r5r/reference/setup_r5.md)
  before.

## r5r 0.3-0

CRAN release: 2021-01-05

**Major changes**

- Added Conveyal’s R5 repo as a git submodule. This will help improve
  the long term integration between r5r and R5. Closed \#105.
- Internal changes to make r5r compatible with R5 latest version 6.0.1.

**Minor changes**

- Added columns with population and number of schools in sample data set
  of Porto Alegre to allow for accessibility examples. Closed \#128.

## r5r 0.2-0

CRAN release: 2020-10-20

**Major changes**

- Function `travel_time_matrix` now has new parameters `time_window` and
  `percentiles` it now calculates travel times for multiple departure
  times each minute within a given time window. For now, the function
  automatically set the number of Monte Carlo Draws to 5 times the size
  of `time_window`. Closes \#104 and \#118

**Minor changes**

- Added a sample of frequency-based GTFS for Sao Paulo. Closed \#116
- Improved documentation of routing functions adding more info on the
  routing algorithms used in R5. Closes \#114

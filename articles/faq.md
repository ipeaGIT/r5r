# FAQ - Frequently Asked Questions

Abstract

A short list of responses and clarifications about Frequently Asked
Questions from r5r users.

## 1. Why do some trips from/to the same ID have travel times larger than zero?

> This can happen when the input point is distant to any routable road
> segment. In this case, R5 will snap the point to the closest road
> segment that can be traversed with the selected transport mode, and it
> will consider that the person would walk in Euclidean distance from
> the input point to the snapped location. So R5 is accounting for this
> walking time “as the crow flies” in the routing.

## 2. Is it possible to run `r5r` with custom modifications to street network data?

click to expand

> Yes, all routing and accessibility functions in `r5r` have the
> parameters `new_carspeeds`, `carspeed_scale` and `new_lts` which allow
> one to use custom car speeds and LTS levels for cycling. These
> parameters provide convenient and efficient ways to build different
> scenarios of traffic congestion, road closure and interventions in
> cycling infrastructure. [See this
> vignette](https://ipeagit.github.io/r5r/articles/scenarios.html). For
> other changes to the OSM network (e.g. including a new road link), you
> would need to edit the OpenStreetMap `.pbf` file directly before using
> it in `r5r`. To do this, you can edit the `.pbf` file with [JOSM
> (https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/JOSM)](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/JOSM).
> OpenStreetMap tags can be changed but not removed.

## 3. Why are the output results of `travel_time_matrix()` and `detailed_itineraries()` different?

click to expand

> The functions
> [`travel_time_matrix()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/r5r/reference/travel_time_matrix.md)
> (and
> [`expanded_travel_time_matrix()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/r5r/reference/expanded_travel_time_matrix.md))
> and
> [`detailed_itineraries()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/r5r/reference/detailed_itineraries.md)
> use different routing algorithms, as explained in the documentation of
> these functions. As such, we advise not to use or combine the output
> of these functions.

## 4. What does the ERROR “Geographic extent of street layer exceeds limit” mean? and what to do about it?

click to expand

> An error like *“Geographic extent of street layer (5315196 km2)
> exceeds limit of 975000 km2”* means your study area is too large. The
> limit is hardcoded in R5, so r5r cannot change it. The **solution** is
> to crop the `OpenStreetMap.pbf` to your area of interest, e.g. with
> [Osmosis](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Osmosis). Download the
> [latest Osmosis
> release](https://github.com/openstreetmap/osmosis/releases), then call
> it from R:

    # get the bounding box of your study area
    study_area_polygon <- geobr::read_state(code_state = "ES")
    area_bbox <- sf::st_bbox(study_area_polygon)

    # input: the path to osmosis and the large pbf file in your local computer
    osmosis_path <- "./osmosis_dir/bin/osmosis.bat"
    large_pbf_path <- "./project_dir/large.pbf"

    # path where you want to save the smaller .pbf file
    smaller_pbf <-"./project_dir/smaller.pbf"

    # prepare call to osmosis
    osmosis_cmd <- sprintf("%s --read-pbf %s --bounding-box left=%s bottom=%s right=%s top=%s --write-pbf %s",
                           osmosis_path, large_pbf_path,
                           area_bbox["xmin"], area_bbox["ymin"], area_bbox["xmax"], area_bbox["ymax"],
                           smaller_pbf)

    # call to osmosis
    shell(osmosis_cmd, translate = TRUE)

## 5. Is it possible to use custom car speed data with r5r?

click to expand

> Yes. By default, R5 considers the max speed limit of each road as set
> in OpenStreetMap data. You can change car speeds from within R with
> the `new_carspeeds` and `carspeed_scale` parameters of the routing
> functions. [See this
> vignette](https://ipeagit.github.io/r5r/articles/scenarios.html).

## 6. Why do I get identical results by public transport and walking?

click to expand

> If your travel time / accessibility results are identical for public
> transport and walking, it is probably because R5 did not detect that
> the public transport network is available for your requested trips.
> This is likely to occur in case you set a `departure_datetime` outside
> the calendar of public transport operations in your GTFS data. Check
> the `calendar.txt` file in your gtfs.zip feed. Alternatively, this
> could occur because there is no public transport trip option that
> would be faster than walking for the given origin-destination pair you
> queried.
